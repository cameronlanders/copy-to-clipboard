# Javascript Copy To Clipboard #

## Pure Javascript function to copy a textbox value to the client side clipboard.

Just clone this repo to a test folder on your local machine. The sample HTML file shows the scipt and implementation. You can test it out by opening the ```copy-to-clipboard.html``` file in a browser.

This uses the new [Javascript Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API), which should work in all modern browsers.
